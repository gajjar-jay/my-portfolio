        <p>I'm a front-end web developer with a background in computer systems and network infrastructure. My 5 years of
            IT experience has given me a strong foundation for web development and building complex solutions. I'm currently 
            working as Angular Developer. I am intense about
            coding and solving problems through code, and I am excited to work alongside other amazing programmers and
            learn so much more!</p>
